    <h1>Hi, My Name is Jacquelyn Garcia! ðŸ‘‹</h1>
    <div class="intro">
    <div class="custom-font">
    <p>Welcome to my portfolio! I'm a Data Science student at UC San Diego, currently entering my senior year and graduating in Spring 2026. Iâ€™m passionate about technology and thrive at the intersection of software engineering, data engineering, and machine learning. Over the past few years, Iâ€™ve worked on a range of projectsâ€”from building APIs and automation pipelines to designing equitable AI systems and large-scale data solutions. I love solving real-world problems with data, and Iâ€™m always excited to learn, build, and collaborate.</p></div>
